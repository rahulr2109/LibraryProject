Explanation

Library Class:

Manages a collection of Item objects.
Provides methods to add, remove, borrow, and return items.
Ensures periodicals cannot be borrowed.

Item Class and Subclasses:

Item is an abstract class with common properties (title, author).
Book, CD, DVD, and Periodical extend Item with specific behaviors if needed.

Main Class:

Demonstrates adding items, borrowing items, and listing items in the library.

The Item class is defined as an abstract class to serve as a base class for all types of items (Books, CDs, DVDs, and Periodicals) in the library. Making it abstract provides several benefits and ensures appropriate application of object-oriented principles:

Shared Characteristics and Behavior:

The Item class encapsulates properties that are common to all library items, such as title and author.
By defining these common properties in the Item class, we avoid code duplication and ensure consistency across all item types.

Abstraction:

The Item class is intended to be a conceptual representation rather than a concrete implementation. By making it abstract, we signal that it should not be instantiated directly.
This abstraction layer allows us to define a common interface for all items while allowing specific item types to provide their unique implementations if needed.

Polymorphism:

Abstract classes support polymorphism, allowing us to treat all item types (Book, CD, DVD, Periodical) as instances of the Item class.
This is particularly useful in the Library class, where we can store and manage a collection of Item objects without needing to know their specific types.

Inheritance:

Concrete classes (Book, CD, DVD, Periodical) inherit from the Item class, gaining its properties and methods.
This promotes code reuse and a cleaner design by centralizing common functionality in the Item class.

In summary, the Item class is abstract to enforce a common structure for all items in the library, promote code reuse, enable polymorphism, and prevent instantiation of a generic Item which doesnâ€™t represent a real-world entity on its own. Each subclass represents a specific type of item that can be instantiated and managed within the library.
